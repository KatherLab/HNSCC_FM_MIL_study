This folder contains modifications to the STAMP original scripts to accomodate the behaviour described in the paper (alternating use of augmentations for training).
This also modified the CV as we assume we will validate on external data, thus not needing the extra chunk that is shaved off in the original STAMP implementation.
For usage with STAMP 1.01 just substitute the scripts with the same names as the ones here with the ones found in our repository.
