STAMP-1.0.1 compatible model objects (.pkl) for deployment are stored here for all 3 endpoints and models for 2D, multiview and 3D MIL.
Best models reported in the paper are the 2D models, with SwinViT working best for OS and LRC and BioMedClip for FFDM. All models do end up showing not so dissimilar 2-year AUCs.
STAMP 1.0.1 uses these models through the config.yaml file with the deploy flag alongside the usual parameters
