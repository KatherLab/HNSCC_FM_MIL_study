Scripts and .yaml file for PyRadiomics 3.1.0 extraction


For extraction, just place the .yaml file and make sure to have a CSV with the ID of the patient, absolute path to the CT scan and the mask in the same directoy as the extraction script. 

Then go into the processing script and edit the file and temporary dict variables and run the script from terminal.

NIFTI images before resampling work just fine from our experience.
